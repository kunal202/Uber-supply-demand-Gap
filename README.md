# Uber-supply-demand-Gap
In this Analysis we are about to find out why Uber faces so many cancellation and Non-availability of cars from airport to city and vice-versa throughout the day.
After all the Analysis we found that in the morning that large nummber of rides were cancelled and in  the evening due to non-availability of cars less numer of people were booking for Uber.
So, Based on the Analysis done, Uber can conisder the following solution in order to overcome this situaion :
  Morning Time
  i) Uber can give some bonus to the drivers to who confirms the ride in the morning to avoid cancellation of Rides.
  ii) Uber can pay for the gas mileage of drivers to come back to the city without a ride.
  iii) Uber can increase the demand at the airport to reduce idle time â€“ by increased marketing and price cuts for the passengers.
  
  Evening Time
  i) Uber can give some bonus to the drivers to who confirms the ride in the evening to increase more number of drivers on airport so that      issue of non-availability of cars could be resolved.
  ii) Uber can pay some amount of toll tax given by dirvers to come to the airport so that more number of drivers could show up.
  iii) Uber can reward some credit points to passengers uber account who pool with other passengers so that one car could take more number        of passengers.
